# 🚀 My Computer Vision Journey

> Documenting my path from deepfake practitioner to experienced computer vision engineer — one month at a time.

Currently building expertise in generative models, evaluation metrics, and ethical AI at **IDVerse Australia**.

## ⚡ Quick Start

This project uses `conda` to manage dependencies and ensure reproducibility. Follow these steps to set up your environment locally. Compatible with CUDA 12.0 system.

```bash
# Clone & set up environment
git clone https://github.com/carmelocs/computer-vision-journey.git
cd computer-vision-journey
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cv-journey
```

🐞 If something breaks: `conda deactivate && conda env remove -n cv-journey` then rebuild.
