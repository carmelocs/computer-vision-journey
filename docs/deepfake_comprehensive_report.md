## Introduction

Deepfakes represent synthetic media generated using artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep learning models. The technology has evolved from simple face-swapping applications to sophisticated systems capable of generating highly realistic videos, images, and audio content. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of both generation and detection techniques, examining their strengths, limitations, and future prospects.
