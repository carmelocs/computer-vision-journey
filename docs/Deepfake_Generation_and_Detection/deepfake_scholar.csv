"Deepfakes generation and detection: State-of-the-art, open challenges, countermeasures, and way forward",601,"Easy access to audio-visual content on social media, combined with the availability of modern tools such as Tensorflow or Keras, open-source trained models, and economical computing infrastructure, and the rapid evolution of deep-learning (DL) methods, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), have made it possible to generate deepfakes to disseminate disinformation, revenge porn, financial frauds, hoaxes, and to disrupt government functioning. The existing surveys have mainly focused on deepfake video detection only. No attempt has been made to review approaches for detection and generation of both audio and video deepfakes. This paper provides a comprehensive review and detailed analysis of existing tools and machine learning (ML) based approaches for deepfake generation and the methodologies used to detect such manipulations for the detection and generation of both audio and video deepfakes. For each category of deepfake, we discuss information related to manipulation approaches, current public datasets, and key standards for the performance evaluation of deepfake detection techniques along with their results. Additionally, we also discuss open challenges and enumerate future directions to guide future researchers on issues that need to be considered to improve the domains of both the deepfake generation and detection. This work is expected to assist the readers in understanding the creation and detection mechanisms of deepfake, along with their current limitations and future direction.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00484,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-022-03766-z,"M Nawaz, KM Malik, A Javed, A Irtaza","M Nawaz:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cor7r8AAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

Deepfake media generation and detection in the generative AI era: a survey and outlook,9,"With the recent advancements in generative modeling, the realism of deepfake content has been increasing at a steady pace, even reaching the point where people often fail to detect manipulated media content online, thus being deceived into various kinds of scams. In this paper, we survey deepfake generation and detection techniques, including the most recent developments in the field, such as diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields. Our literature review covers all deepfake media types, comprising image, video, audio and multimodal (audio-visual) content. We identify various kinds of deepfakes, according to the procedure used to alter or generate the fake content. We further construct a taxonomy of deepfake generation and detection methods, illustrating the important groups of methods and the domains where these methods are applied. Next, we gather datasets used for deepfake detection and provide updated rankings of the best performing deepfake detectors on the most popular datasets. In addition, we develop a novel multimodal benchmark to evaluate deepfake detectors on out-of-distribution content. The results indicate that state-of-the-art detectors fail to generalize to deepfake content generated by unseen deepfake generators.

DeepFake detection for human face images and videos: A survey,239,"Techniques for creating and manipulating multimedia information have progressed to the point where they can now ensure a high degree of realism. DeepFake is a generative deep learning algorithm that creates or modifies face features in a superrealistic form, in which it is difficult to distinguish between real and fake features. This technology has greatly advanced and promotes a wide range of applications in TV channels, video game industries, and cinema, such as improving visual effects in movies, as well as a variety of criminal activities, such as misinformation generation by mimicking famous people. To identify and classify DeepFakes, research in DeepFake detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted increased interest. Basically, DeepFake is the regenerated media that is obtained by injecting or replacing some information within the DNN model. In this survey, we will summarize the DeepFake detection methods in face images and videos on the basis of their results, performance, methodology used and detection type. We will review the existing types of DeepFake creation techniques and sort them into five major categories. Generally, DeepFake models are trained on DeepFake datasets and tested with experiments. Moreover, we will summarize the available DeepFake dataset trends, focusing on their improvements. Additionally, the issue of how DeepFake detection aims to generate a generalized DeepFake detection model will be analyzed.

Deepfakes generation and detection: A short survey,109,"Advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of free, large databases have made it possible, even for non-technical people, to either manipulate or generate realistic facial samples for both benign and malicious purposes. DeepFakes refer to face multimedia content, which has been digitally altered or synthetically created using deep neural networks. The paper first outlines the readily available face editing apps and the vulnerability (or performance degradation) of face recognition systems under various face manipulations. Next, this survey presents an overview of the techniques and works that have been carried out in recent years for deepfake and face manipulations. Especially, four kinds of deepfake or face manipulations are reviewed, i.e., identity swap, face reenactment, attribute manipulation, and entire face synthesis. For each category, deepfake or face manipulation generation methods as well as those manipulation detection methods are detailed. Despite significant progress based on traditional and advanced computer vision, artificial intelligence, and physics, there is still a huge arms race surging up between attackers/offenders/adversaries (i.e., DeepFake generation methods) and defenders (i.e., DeepFake detection methods).

Deepfake detection: A systematic literature review,486,"Over the last few decades, rapid progress in AI, machine learning, and deep learning has resulted in new techniques and various tools for manipulating multimedia. Though the technology has been mostly used in legitimate applications such as for entertainment and education, etc., malicious users have also exploited them for unlawful or nefarious purposes. For example, high-quality and realistic fake videos, images, or audios have been created to spread misinformation and propaganda, foment political discord and hate, or even harass and blackmail people. The manipulated, high-quality and realistic videos have become known recently as Deepfake. Various approaches have since been described in the literature to deal with the problems raised by Deepfake. To provide an updated overview of the research works in Deepfake detection, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) in this paper, summarizing 112 relevant articles from 2018 to 2020 that presented a variety of methodologies. We analyze them by grouping them into four different categories: deep learning-based techniques, classical machine learning-based methods, statistical techniques, and blockchain-based techniques.

Deepfake generation and detection: Case study and challenges,131,"In smart communities, social media allowed users easy access to multimedia content. With recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models have evolved. With advancements in generative adversarial networks (GAN), it has become possible to create fake images/audio/and video streams of a person or use some person’s audio and visual details to fit other environments. Thus, deepfakes are specifically used to disseminate fake information and propaganda on social circles that tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization. Recently, many surveys have focused on generating and detecting deepfake images, audio, and video streams. Existing surveys are mostly aligned toward detecting deepfake contents, but the generation process is not suitably discussed. To address the survey gap, the paper proposes a comprehensive review of deepfake generation and detection and the different ML/DL approaches to synthesize deepfake contents. We discuss a comparative analysis of deepfake models and public datasets present for deepfake detection purposes.
